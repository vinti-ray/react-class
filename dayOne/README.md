ReactJS Preparation - Day 1 

# What is ReactJS? 
ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front-end library which is responsible only for the view layer of the application. It was 
initially developed and maintained by Facebook and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram. 


 # Resource - What Is React (React js) & Why Is It So Popular? 
Features of ReactJS 
The developer community loves Reactjs for its robust features. Some of the Reactjs features that distinguish it from the rest are: 

 ● Virtual DOM is one of the chief characteristics that facilitate fast and flexible application development using Reactjs. Its memory reconciliation algorithm enables React to replicate a web page in its virtual memory. In this way, a virtual DOM is the representation of an original DOM. 
With every modification in the web application, the virtual DOM re-renders the entire user interface. In a virtual DOM representation, only the components that have actually changed are updated and not all the component 

 ● JSX syntax - JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a markup syntax that is very similar to HTML and is used to describe the appearance of an application’s UI. JSX is one of the best features that Reactjs has to offer. 

It makes the syntax, used by developers to create React components, almost identical to the HTML they will inject in the web page. This makes
writing the building blocks of Reactjs effortless and simple for the developers and gives them an easy way out. 

 ● One way data binding - One of the major reasons why you should choose Reactjs for your next project is its one-way data flow. Reactjs uses a unidirectional data flow. Meaning, the developers cannot edit any component directly. They have to utilize the callback function in order to make changes in the components. This process is called one-way data binding. 
Reactjs uses Flux, a JavaScript app architecture, to control the data flow from a single point. A unidirectional data flow helps Reactjs developers to gain better control over the web or mobile application. This enhances the flexibility of the application and makes it more efficient. 

● Declarative UI - As mentioned earlier, Reactjs is the best for creating engaging and interactive user interfaces for mobile and web applications. In an event of data modification, Reactjs adequately renders and updates just the right components. 

It generates a simple view for each state of the application. This feature makes the code more readable and simpler to debug. 

● Component-based architecture - The architecture of Reactjs is component-based. In other words, the UI of a React-based mobile or web application is divided into multiple components. Each component has its own specific logic. The logic is written in JavaScript instead of using templates. This enables Reactjs developers to pass the data throughout the application without affecting the DOM. 

## Benefits & Drawbacks of ReactJS 
## Benefits 
 Virtual DOM - Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) is responsible for React’s performance and speed. Thanks to it, developers can create fast applications that are up to modern standards. What’s DOM, though? It’s a tree structure of XML, HTML, or XHTML documents, in other words – a virtual representation of
the document object model. However, DOM didn’t seem to be enough for React JS. 

 There had to be something else to it to make it faster, better, and more versatile. React’s developers came up with the idea to use the virtual version of the DOM and that was a bingo! Virtual DOM allows devs to update even the smallest components of the app without influencing its entirety. 

 Virtual DOM is nothing else than a virtual copy of the real DOM. Additionally, it requires less time to update than a regular DOM which is a huge advantage. 
  
 Reusable Components - Reusable components are one of the factors that influence React’s popularity. They make the development process much easier as the developers don’t have to write the code from scratch for similar things and can reuse components in their future projects. 

 In fact, we can safely assume that they’re one of the most important features of React when it comes to web app development. They not only make the coding life easier, but they also speed up the entire development process making React one of the best technologies available. 

Community - The library definitely has strong community support and that can be attributed to the fact that React is open-source. Whether you face a problem, a bug, or anything else, we’re sure that the community will always be there to provide you with any help they can. 

Not only that, there’s a ton of YouTube videos, tutorials, how-to’s, articles, React-centric web development blogs, and other publications that are available to everyone for free! 

Seo-Friendliness - This JavaScript library is actually one of the best tools for creating SEO-based web apps! Long loading time may also be the cause of problems with the website itself.

With React, developers can reduce loading time and enhance the rendering speed of a web app. That alone makes a huge difference in the performance of a website. 

Ease of Learning - More and more companies lean towards using React in building their new applications. The reason for that is that React JS is easier than most frameworks. 

React Native - With the React Native framework, you can program applications for Android, iOS, Windows, or even Oculus. React Native should appeal to a vast majority of developers as it features a lot of advantages. 

First of all, it’s a declarative framework, which means that coding a declarative UI should be easier with a more predictable code. 

Similar to React JS, React Native is based on components that when developed, create complete user interfaces. 

Finally, the written code can be reused between platforms like iOS, Android, and others! 
One-Way Data - Flow Usually, frameworks feature a two-way data flow and it means that whenever you make a change, an entire application also changes or requires a change. When it comes to React though, it features a one-way data flow that ensures code stability. 

Thanks to it, any change made in a particular section doesn’t influence the structure of the entire app. That essentially means that if you alter child components it doesn’t affect the parent data in any way. 

React Developer Tools - Not only is React a great library for building user interfaces but it also is supported by React Developer Tools which is a browser extension available for both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

Created by Facebook, the tools are updated constantly with the latest version being released on September 2nd, 2021. Additionally, they have been used by over 2,000,000 users! 

High-compatibility - React is created to work seamlessly with other JS libraries and does not limit the possibility of using additional tools for website creation. It allows you to choose any suitable React extension that, with the help of outside controllers, will define the view layer of the page. 

Sometimes it’s enough to work with React on simple pages. However, the more complex the page, the more libraries it requires for proper functioning.

Scalability - React’s modular design makes it easier to scale than many other platforms. Simply adding components, replacing old ones with more robust versions, and making application changes piecemeal rather than wholesale makes ramping up an application to meet demands and improvements more straightforward and safer too.

## Drawbacks 
Development Pace - React JS is constantly evolving and changing. The pace at which React is developed can be seen as an advantage or a disadvantage depending on who you are. 

The developers who see these ongoing changes as an advantage would argue that React is constantly being improved and making their jobs easier. The developers who see the pace of development as a disadvantage would argue that they have to constantly relearn how to work with React JS, which is difficult to keep up with. 

It should be noted, though, that React’s core API has gotten a lot more stable in recent years. Most updates today affect the library and new features.

Lack of Documentation - This drawback is tied to people’s concern with the pace of React’s development. As a result of rapid development, educational documentation and resources can be sparse in covering the latest updates and changes. Due to the number of updates and new releases, there’s simply not enough time for writing complete documentation. Since ReactJS is an open source framework, developers are able to create their own support documents, but since anyone can create these resources, you could come across poor resources that offer little help. 

Non-Vigilant Focus on User Interface - React contains a myriad of tools used to develop and create user interfaces. However, unlike frameworks, React JS is not an ‘all-in-one-tool’ for app development. 

Therefore, if you happen to use a model-view-controller (MVC), React development is only responsible for the UI. The developers have to create the model and controller part by using other tools. 

To create a functional application, you will have to apply more tools that will cover other crucial parts like backend and data storage. You will need additional tools for app programming interfaces (APIs), routing, and other parts as well. 

JSX as a Barrier - In simple terms, JSX is a JavaScript extension that can make the code more readable and clean. While the JSX syntax extension makes things easier for some developers, other web developers and designers find the JSX code too complex and challenging to grasp. 

JSX doesn’t negatively impact the performance or User Interface capabilities of ReactJS. This con is more of a preference than anything else.

## How ReactJS is different from HTML 

HTML is the language of the web, but creating entire websites with HTML alone can be repetitive and hard to manage. 

React arrived in 2013 as a better way to build web apps with JavaScript. It's often referred to as a library for building UIs, short for "user interfaces". 

What makes React such a desirable library to learn is that it doesn't replace HTML. 

It takes advantage of HTML's popularity and strength as the most popular programming language, by letting you use a very similar syntax to HTML to build interfaces and add dynamic features to it using JavaScript. 

The difference between HTML and React is their purpose. HTML is a markup language, and in modern web development, it's being used to structure websites. On the other hand, React is a library for building websites. It uses plain HTML, but on top of that, it provides a lot of handy features that add interactivity, and complex logic to websites.

Setting Up System for ReactJS Development 

Here’s the necessary softwares/tools to install before we can start with React Development - 

● Install Node.js & NPM 

● Install React 

npm install --save react 

● Go to the Directory where you need the application 

● Create react app - 

npx create-react-app my-fast-app 

Good to have developer tools, which will help you build and debug your React Application - 

● React Developer Tools 

● React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets for VS Code ● Typescript React code snippets 

Let’s create a simple React Application 

As now we have set up our system, let’s build a very basic react application to get started on it. 
Code - 

In HTML File - 

<div id="root"> 
  <!-- This element's contents will be replaced with your component. --> </div> 
In JSX - 
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')); root.render(<h1>Hello, world!</h1>);
